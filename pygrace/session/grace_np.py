Grace (xmgrace) is a very nice X program for doing 2-D graphics.  It
is very flexible, produces beautiful output, and has a graphical user
interface.  It is available from
<http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/>.  Grace is the successor to
ACE/gr and xmgr.

This module implements a pipe-based interface to grace similar to the
one provided by the grace_np library included with grace.  I haven't
used it very much so it is likely that it still has bugs.  I am
releasing it in the hope that it might be of use to the community.  If
you find a problem or have a suggestion, please let me know at
<mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>.  Other feedback is also welcome.

For a demonstration, run this file by typing `python grace_np.py'.
See the bottom of the file to see how the demonstration is programmed.

About the module:

At first I tried just to translate grace_np from C to python, but then
I realized that it is possible to do a much nicer job using classes.
The main class here is GraceProcess, which creates a running copy of
the grace program, and creates a pipe connection to it.  Through an
instance of this class you can send commands to grace.

Note that grace interprets command streams differently depending on
their source.  The pipe represented by this class is connected in such
a way that grace expects `parameter-file'-style commands (without the
@ or & or whatever).

[Details: this class communicates to grace through a -dpipe which
specified an open file descriptor from which it is to read commands.
This is the same method used by the grace_np that comes with grace.  I
thought that the -pipe option might be more convenient--just pipe
commands to standard input.  However, grace interprets commands
differently when it receives them from these two sources: -dpipe
expects parameter-file information, whereas -pipe expects datafile
information.  Also -pipe doesn't seem to respond to the `close'
command (but maybe the same effect could be had by just closing the
pipe).]
