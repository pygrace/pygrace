Python bindings to xmgrace

About Pygrace
-------------
``pygrace`` was designed to enable the construction and use of ``xmgrace`` projects from Python.  ``pygrace`` provides a collection of classes that serve as editable templates for elements of a xmgrace project. The inheritance structure of ``pygrace`` mirrors the structure of ``xmgrace``.

``pygrace`` ``Project`` objects are used to construct and save ``xmgrace`` project files (.agr). ``Project`` files capture the state of a ``xmgrace`` session, including the figures, settings, and current variables.

A more detailed diagram of all the attributes of ``pygrace`` template objects can be found at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/blob/master/docs/diagrams/diagram.pdf, while a handy cheatsheet of the methods and attributes of each ``pygrace`` template class can be found at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/blob/master/docs/diagrams/cheatsheet.pdf. This cheatsheet can be dynamically generated through use of the ``write_cheatsheet`` method, available from the ``Project`` class.

``pygrace`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments, or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of issues is located at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/issues, with a legacy list maintained at https://github.com/pygrace/pygrace/issues.


Major Features
--------------
``pygrace`` provides an object-oriented Python interface for the efficient construction of ``xmgrace`` projects (e.g. highly-customizable publication-quality single and multi-figure plots). ``pygrace`` provides:

* an object-relational mapping from Python objects to a ``xmgrace`` project
* an interactive Python-based ``grace>`` prompt for ``xmgrace`` commands
* a set of high-level Python functions for drawing ``xmgrace`` ``Graphs``

Installation
------------
``pygrace`` can be installed with ``pip``::

    $ pip install pygrace

It is assumed ``xmgrace`` is already installed and on the user's ``$PATH``.  ``xmgrace`` is available at:
    https://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/grace/src/

Alternately, ``xmgrace`` typically can be installed with most package managers. For example::

    $ apt-get install grace # on Linux
    $ brew install grace # on MacOS

Installing an Xserver from X.org (``xorg``, ``xorg-server``, ``xquartz``, or similar, depending on your operating system and package manager) is also required to open the ``xmgrace`` GUI.


Requirements
------------
``pygrace`` requires:

* ``python`` (or ``pypy``), **>=3.7**
* ``setuptools``, **>=42**
* ``cython``, **>=0.29.30**
* ``numpy``, **>=1.0**
* ``mpmath``, **>=0.19**

Additional requirements:

* ``xmgrace``, **>=5.1.14**


Basic Usage
-----------
start a ``pygrace`` project file::

    >>> from pygrace.project import Project
    >>> plot = Project()

add a ``Graph`` to the ``Project`` instance::

    >>> graph = plot.add_graph()
    >>> graph.title.text = 'Hello, world!'

add a ``DataSet`` to the graph::

    >>> data = [(0, 0), (0.5, 0.75), (1, 1)]
    >>> dataset = graph.add_dataset(data)

save the ``Project`` to a xmgrace project file (.agr format)::

    >>> plot.saveall('00_helloworld.agr')

then, open the project file with xmgrace::

    $ xmgrace 00_helloworld.agr

![00_helloworld](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/00_helloworld.png)

find out more about ``pygrace`` at http://pygrace.rtfd.io or browse some more of the examples at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/tree/master/examples.

for example::

    $ python 05_colorplot.py
    $ xmgrace 05_colorplot.agr

![05_colorplot](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/05_colorplot.png)

and::

    $ python 08_latexlabels.py
    $ xmgrace 08_latexlabels.agr

![08_latexlabels](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/08_latexlabels.png)


we can also work in an interactive xmgrace session::

    >>> from pygrace import grace
    >>> pg = grace()

use xmgrace methods directly from the Python interpreter::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.arange(21) * np.pi/10
    >>> pg.plot(x, np.sin(x))

![sin](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/sin.png)

push variables into xmgrace and interact with the xmgrace scripting language::

    >>> pg.put('x', x)
    >>> pg.put('y', np.cos(x))
    >>> pg.eval('s0 line color 2')
    >>> pg.eval('plot(x,y)')

![cos](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/cos.png)

use the interactive xmgrace prompt::

    >>> pg.prompt()
    grace interface:
    vars=
         y
         x
    grace> histoPlot(y)
    grace> s0 fill color 3
    grace> redraw()
    grace> exit

![histoPlot](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/raw/master/docs/source/_static/histoPlot.png)

check variables in xmgrace session::

    >>> list(pg.who().keys())
    ['x', 'y']
    >>> pg.who('x')
    array([0.        , 0.31415927, 0.62831853, 0.9424778 , 1.25663706,
           1.57079633, 1.88495559, 2.19911486, 2.51327412, 2.82743339,
           3.14159265, 3.45575192, 3.76991118, 4.08407045, 4.39822972,
           4.71238898, 5.02654825, 5.34070751, 5.65486678, 5.96902604,
           6.28318531])

get variables back into Python from xmgrace::

    >>> cosx = pg.get('y')

use shortcuts for put, eval, and get::

    >>> pg.z = 0.5
    >>> pg('print(z)')
    0.5
    >>> pg.z + cosx
    array([ 1.5       ,  1.45105652,  1.30901699,  1.08778525,  0.80901699,
            0.5       ,  0.19098301, -0.08778525, -0.30901699, -0.45105652,
           -0.5       , -0.45105652, -0.30901699, -0.08778525,  0.19098301,
            0.5       ,  0.80901699,  1.08778525,  1.30901699,  1.45105652,
            1.5       ])

delete variables from xmgrace::

    >>> pg.delete('x')
    >>> pg.delete('y')

save the current session to a project file, then exit::

    >>> pg.saveall('histoPlot.agr')
    >>> pg.exit()

start a new interactive xmgrace session from the saved project::

    >>> pg = grace(project='histoPlot.agr')


More Information
----------------
Probably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at
http://pygrace.rtfd.io. Also see ``pygrace.tests`` for a set of scripts that
demonstrate several of the many features of ``pygrace``. You can run the test
suite with ``python -m pygrace.tests``. Also see https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/tree/master/examples for examples that demonstrate the construction
of ``xmgrace`` project files (.agr). https://github.com/uqfoundation/pygrace/tree/master/examples/interactive includes examples of using ``python`` to interact
with a live ``xmgrace`` session. The source code is relatively well documented,
so some questions may be resolved by inspecting the code itself.  However,
please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a question on
stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**). If you would like to share how you use
``pygrace`` in your work, please send an email (to **mmckerns at uqfoundation
dot org**).
