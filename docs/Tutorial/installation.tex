As pygrace is still young, the only method yet available to install it
is to download the source code from:

\begin{command}
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygrace
\end{command}

\noindent
The subsection titled \textit{Installing a development version}
describes how to download the source code.

Install pygrace (to python's site-packages directory):

\begin{command}
python setup.py install
\end{command}

This will put pygrace on the {\tt PYTHONPATH}, so import statement
in python scripts can find the pygrace library.

You can test that pygrace was installed corrctly by opening
an interactive python prompt and typing:

\begin{command}
import pygrace
\end{command}

If no error is raised, then installation was succesful!
