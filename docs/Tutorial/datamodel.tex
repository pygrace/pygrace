pygrace was designed so that, ``anything you can do in xmgrace, you can
do in pygrace.''  Figure \ref{crowdiagram} is a diagram showing the
basic organization of the pygrace structure --- it basically mirrors
the xmgrace file format structure.  One thing to note is that Drawing
Objects can be associated with either a Project or a Graph.  This is
important in cases where one want to, e.g., create a custom data
symbol and have the symbol show up in the coordinate system of a
graph.
